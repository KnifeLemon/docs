# Routing

## Overview
Routing in Flight PHP maps URL patterns to callback functions or class methods, enabling fast and simple request handling. It is designed for minimal overhead, beginner-friendly usage, and extensibility without external dependencies.

## Understanding
Routing is the core mechanism that connects HTTP requests to your application logic in Flight. By defining routes, you specify how different URLs trigger specific code, whether through functions, class methods, or controller actions. Flightâ€™s routing system is flexible, supporting basic patterns, named parameters, regular expressions, and advanced features like dependency injection and resourceful routing. This approach keeps your code organized and easy to maintain, while remaining fast and simple for beginners and extensible for advanced users.

> **Note:** Want to understand more about routing? Check out the ["why a framework?"](/learn/why-frameworks) page for a more in-depth explanation.

## Basic Usage

### Defining a Simple Route
Basic routing in Flight is done by matching a URL pattern with a callback function or an array of a class and method.

```php
Flight::route('/', function(){
    echo 'hello world!';
});
```

> Routes are matched in the order they are defined. The first route to match a request will be invoked.

### Using Functions as Callbacks
The callback can be any object that is callable. So you can use a regular function:

```php
function hello() {
    echo 'hello world!';
}

Flight::route('/', 'hello');
```

### Using Classes and Methods as a Controller
You can use a method (static or not) of a class as well:

```php
class GreetingController {
    public function hello() {
        echo 'hello world!';
    }
}

Flight::route('/', [ 'GreetingController','hello' ]);
// or
Flight::route('/', [ GreetingController::class, 'hello' ]); // preferred method
// or
Flight::route('/', [ 'GreetingController::hello' ]);
// or 
Flight::route('/', [ 'GreetingController->hello' ]);
```

Or by creating an object first and then calling the method:

```php
use flight\Engine;

// GreetingController.php
class GreetingController
{
	protected Engine $app
    public function __construct(Engine $app) {
		$this->app = $app;
        $this->name = 'John Doe';
    }

    public function hello() {
        echo "Hello, {$this->name}!";
    }
}

// index.php
$app = Flight::app();
$greeting = new GreetingController($app);

Flight::route('/', [ $greeting, 'hello' ]);
```

> **Note:** By default when a controller is called within the framework, the `flight\Engine` class is always injected unless you specify through a [dependency injection container](/learn/dependency-injection-container)

### Method-Specific Routing

By default, route patterns are matched against all request methods. You can respond
to specific methods by placing an identifier before the URL.

```php
Flight::route('GET /', function () {
  echo 'I received a GET request.';
});

Flight::route('POST /', function () {
  echo 'I received a POST request.';
});

// You cannot use Flight::get() for routes as that is a method 
//    to get variables, not create a route.
Flight::post('/', function() { /* code */ });
Flight::patch('/', function() { /* code */ });
Flight::put('/', function() { /* code */ });
Flight::delete('/', function() { /* code */ });
```

You can also map multiple methods to a single callback by using a `|` delimiter:

```php
Flight::route('GET|POST /', function () {
  echo 'I received either a GET or a POST request.';
});
```

### Using the Router Object

Additionally you can grab the Router object which has some helper methods for you to use:

```php

$router = Flight::router();

// maps all methods just like Flight::route()
$router->map('/', function() {
	echo 'hello world!';
});

// GET request
$router->get('/users', function() {
	echo 'users';
});
$router->post('/users', 			function() { /* code */});
$router->put('/users/update/@id', 	function() { /* code */});
$router->delete('/users/@id', 		function() { /* code */});
$router->patch('/users/@id', 		function() { /* code */});
```

### Regular Expressions (Regex)
You can use regular expressions in your routes:

```php
Flight::route('/user/[0-9]+', function () {
  // This will match /user/1234
});
```

Although this method is available, it is recommended to use named parameters, or 
named parameters with regular expressions, as they are more readable and easier to maintain.

### Named Parameters
You can specify named parameters in your routes which will be passed along to
your callback function. **This is more for readability of the route than anything
else. Please see the section below on important caveat.**

```php
Flight::route('/@name/@id', function (string $name, string $id) {
  echo "hello, $name ($id)!";
});
```

You can also include regular expressions with your named parameters by using
the `:` delimiter:

```php
Flight::route('/@name/@id:[0-9]{3}', function (string $name, string $id) {
  // This will match /bob/123
  // But will not match /bob/12345
});
```

> **Note:** Matching regex groups `()` with positional parameters isn't supported. Ex: `:'\(`

#### Important Caveat

While in the example above, it appears as that `@name` is directly tied to the variable `$name`, it is not. The order of the parameters in the callback function is what determines what is passed to it. If you were to switch the order of the parameters in the callback function, the variables would be switched as well. Here is an example:

```php
Flight::route('/@name/@id', function (string $id, string $name) {
  echo "hello, $name ($id)!";
});
```

And if you went to the following URL: `/bob/123`, the output would be `hello, 123 (bob)!`. 
_Please be careful_ when you are setting up your routes and your callback functions!

### Optional Parameters
You can specify named parameters that are optional for matching by wrapping
segments in parentheses.

```php
Flight::route(
  '/blog(/@year(/@month(/@day)))',
  function(?string $year, ?string $month, ?string $day) {
    // This will match the following URLS:
    // /blog/2012/12/10
    // /blog/2012/12
    // /blog/2012
    // /blog
  }
);
```

Any optional parameters that are not matched will be passed in as `NULL`.

### Wildcard Routing
Matching is only done on individual URL segments. If you want to match multiple
segments you can use the `*` wildcard.

```php
Flight::route('/blog/*', function () {
  // This will match /blog/2000/02/01
});
```

To route all requests to a single callback, you can do:

```php
Flight::route('*', function () {
  // Do something
});
```

### 404 Not Found Handler

By default, if a URL can't be found, Flight will send an `HTTP 404 Not Found` response that is very simple and plain.
If you want to have a more customized 404 response, you can [map](/learn/extending) your own `notFound` method:

```php
Flight::map('notFound', function() {
	$url = Flight::request()->url;

	// You could also use Flight::render() with a custom template.
    $output = <<<HTML
		<h1>My Custom 404 Not Found</h1>
		<h3>The page you have requested {$url} could not be found.</h3>
		HTML;

	$this->response()
		->clearBody()
		->status(404)
		->write($output)
		->send();
});
```

## Advanced Usage

### Dependency Injection in Routes
If you want to use dependency injection via a container (PSR-11, PHP-DI, Dice, etc), the
only type of routes where that is available is either directly creating the object yourself
and using the container to create your object or you can use strings to defined the class and
method to call. You can go to the [Dependency Injection](/learn/dependency-injection-container) page for 
more information. 

Here's a quick example:

```php

use flight\database\PdoWrapper;

// Greeting.php
class Greeting
{
	protected PdoWrapper $pdoWrapper;
	public function __construct(PdoWrapper $pdoWrapper) {
		$this->pdoWrapper = $pdoWrapper;
	}

	public function hello(int $id) {
		// do something with $this->pdoWrapper
		$name = $this->pdoWrapper->fetchField("SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = ?", [ $id ]);
		echo "Hello, world! My name is {$name}!";
	}
}

// index.php

// Setup the container with whatever params you need
// See the Dependency Injection page for more information on PSR-11
$dice = new \Dice\Dice();

// Don't forget to reassign the variable with '$dice = '!!!!!
$dice = $dice->addRule('flight\database\PdoWrapper', [
	'shared' => true,
	'constructParams' => [ 
		'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', 
		'root',
		'password'
	]
]);

// Register the container handler
Flight::registerContainerHandler(function($class, $params) use ($dice) {
	return $dice->create($class, $params);
});

// Routes like normal
Flight::route('/hello/@id', [ 'Greeting', 'hello' ]);
// or
Flight::route('/hello/@id', 'Greeting->hello');
// or
Flight::route('/hello/@id', 'Greeting::hello');

Flight::start();
```

### Passing Execution to Next Route
<span class="badge bg-warning">Deprecated</span>
You can pass execution on to the next matching route by returning `true` from
your callback function.

```php
Flight::route('/user/@name', function (string $name) {
  // Check some condition
  if ($name !== "Bob") {
    // Continue to next route
    return true;
  }
});

Flight::route('/user/*', function () {
  // This will get called
});
```

It is now recommended to use [middleware](/learn/middleware) to handle complex use cases like this.

### Route Aliasing
By assigning an alias to a route, you can later call that alias in your app dynamically to be generated later in your code (ex: a link in an HTML template, or generating a redirect URL).

```php
Flight::route('/users/@id', function($id) { echo 'user:'.$id; }, false, 'user_view');
// or 
Flight::route('/users/@id', function($id) { echo 'user:'.$id; })->setAlias('user_view');

// later in code somewhere
class UserController {
	public function update() {

		// code to save user...
		$id = $user['id']; // 5 for example

		$redirectUrl = Flight::getUrl('user_view', [ 'id' => $id ]); // will return '/users/5'
		Flight::redirect($redirectUrl);
	}
}

```

This is especially helpful if your URL happens to change. In the above example, lets say that users was moved to `/admin/users/@id` instead.
With aliasing in place for the route, you no longer need to find all the old URLs in your code and change them because the alias will now return `/admin/users/5` like in the example above.

Route aliasing still works in groups as well:

```php
Flight::group('/users', function() {
    Flight::route('/@id', function($id) { echo 'user:'.$id; }, false, 'user_view');
	// or
	Flight::route('/@id', function($id) { echo 'user:'.$id; })->setAlias('user_view');
});
```

### Inspecting Route Information
If you want to inspect the matching route information, there are 2 ways you can do this:

1. You can use an `executedRoute` property on the `Flight::router()` object.
2. You can request for the route object to be passed to your callback by passing in `true` as the third parameter in the route method. The route object will always be the last parameter passed to your callback function.

#### `executedRoute`
```php
Flight::route('/', function() {
  $route = Flight::router()->executedRoute;
  // Do something with $route
  // Array of HTTP methods matched against
  $route->methods;

  // Array of named parameters
  $route->params;

  // Matching regular expression
  $route->regex;

  // Contains the contents of any '*' used in the URL pattern
  $route->splat;

  // Shows the url path....if you really need it
  $route->pattern;

  // Shows what middleware is assigned to this
  $route->middleware;

  // Shows the alias assigned to this route
  $route->alias;
});
```

> **Note:** The `executedRoute` property will only be set after a route has been executed. If you try to access it before a route has been executed, it will be `NULL`. You can also use executedRoute in [middleware](/learn/middleware) as well!

#### Pass in `true` to route definition
```php
Flight::route('/', function(\flight\net\Route $route) {
  // Array of HTTP methods matched against
  $route->methods;

  // Array of named parameters
  $route->params;

  // Matching regular expression
  $route->regex;

  // Contains the contents of any '*' used in the URL pattern
  $route->splat;

  // Shows the url path....if you really need it
  $route->pattern;

  // Shows what middleware is assigned to this
  $route->middleware;

  // Shows the alias assigned to this route
  $route->alias;
}, true);// <-- This true parameter is what makes that happen
```

### Route Grouping and Middleware
There may be times when you want to group related routes together (such as `/api/v1`).
You can do this by using the `group` method:

```php
Flight::group('/api/v1', function () {
  Flight::route('/users', function () {
	// Matches /api/v1/users
  });

  Flight::route('/posts', function () {
	// Matches /api/v1/posts
  });
});
```

You can even nest groups of groups:

```php
Flight::group('/api', function () {
  Flight::group('/v1', function () {
	// Flight::get() gets variables, it doesn't set a route! See object context below
	Flight::route('GET /users', function () {
	  // Matches GET /api/v1/users
	});

	Flight::post('/posts', function () {
	  // Matches POST /api/v1/posts
	});

	Flight::put('/posts/1', function () {
	  // Matches PUT /api/v1/posts
	});
  });
  Flight::group('/v2', function () {

	// Flight::get() gets variables, it doesn't set a route! See object context below
	Flight::route('GET /users', function () {
	  // Matches GET /api/v2/users
	});
  });
});
```

#### Grouping with Object Context

You can still use route grouping with the `Engine` object in the following way:

```php
$app = Flight::app();

$app->group('/api/v1', function (Router $router) {

  // user the $router variable
  $router->get('/users', function () {
	// Matches GET /api/v1/users
  });

  $router->post('/posts', function () {
	// Matches POST /api/v1/posts
  });
});
```

> **Note:** This is the preferred method of defining routes and groups with the `$router` object.

#### Grouping with Middleware

You can also assign middleware to a group of routes:

```php
Flight::group('/api/v1', function () {
  Flight::route('/users', function () {
	// Matches /api/v1/users
  });
}, [ MyAuthMiddleware::class ]); // or [ new MyAuthMiddleware() ] if you want to use an instance
```

See more details on [group middleware](/learn/middleware#grouping-middleware) page.

### Resource Routing
You can create a set of routes for a resource using the `resource` method. This will create
a set of routes for a resource that follows the RESTful conventions.

To create a resource, do the following:

```php
Flight::resource('/users', UsersController::class);
```

And what will happen in the background is it will create the following routes:

```php
[
      'index' => 'GET /users',
      'create' => 'GET /users/create',
      'store' => 'POST /users',
      'show' => 'GET /users/@id',
      'edit' => 'GET /users/@id/edit',
      'update' => 'PUT /users/@id',
      'destroy' => 'DELETE /users/@id'
]
```

And your controller will use the following methods:

```php
class UsersController
{
    public function index(): void
    {
    }

    public function show(string $id): void
    {
    }

    public function create(): void
    {
    }

    public function store(): void
    {
    }

    public function edit(string $id): void
    {
    }

    public function update(string $id): void
    {
    }

    public function destroy(string $id): void
    {
    }
}
```

> **Note**: You can view the newly added routes with `runway` by running `php runway routes`.

#### Customizing Resource Routes

There are a few options to configure the resource routes.

##### Alias Base

You can configure the `aliasBase`. By default the alias is the last part of the URL specified.
For example `/users/` would result in an `aliasBase` of `users`. When these routes are created,
the aliases are `users.index`, `users.create`, etc. If you want to change the alias, set the `aliasBase`
to the value you want.

```php
Flight::resource('/users', UsersController::class, [ 'aliasBase' => 'user' ]);
```

##### Only and Except

You can also specify which routes you want to create by using the `only` and `except` options.

```php
// Whitelist only these methods and blacklist the rest
Flight::resource('/users', UsersController::class, [ 'only' => [ 'index', 'show' ] ]);
```

```php
// Blacklist only these methods and whitelist the rest
Flight::resource('/users', UsersController::class, [ 'except' => [ 'create', 'store', 'edit', 'update', 'destroy' ] ]);
```

These are basically whitelisting and blacklisting options so you can specify which routes you want to create.

##### Middleware

You can also specify middleware to be run on each of the routes created by the `resource` method.

```php
Flight::resource('/users', UsersController::class, [ 'middleware' => [ MyAuthMiddleware::class ] ]);
```

### Streaming Responses

You can now stream responses to the client using the `stream()` or `streamWithHeaders()`. 
This is useful for sending large files, long running processes, or generating large responses. 
Streaming a route is handled a little differently than a regular route.

> **Note:** Streaming responses is only available if you have [`flight.v2.output_buffering`](/learn/migrating-to-v3#output_buffering) set to `false`.

#### Stream with Manual Headers

You can stream a response to the client by using the `stream()` method on a route. If you 
do this, you must set all the headers by hand before you output anything to the client.
This is done with the `header()` php function or the `Flight::response()->setRealHeader()` method.

```php
Flight::route('/@filename', function($filename) {

	$response = Flight::response();

	// obviously you would sanitize the path and whatnot.
	$fileNameSafe = basename($filename);

	// If you have additional headers to set here after the route has executed
	// you must define them before anything is echoed out.
	// They must all be a raw call to the header() function or 
	// a call to Flight::response()->setRealHeader()
	header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.$fileNameSafe.'"');
	// or
	$response->setRealHeader('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="'.$fileNameSafe.'"');

	$filePath = '/some/path/to/files/'.$fileNameSafe;

	if (!is_readable($filePath)) {
		Flight::halt(404, 'File not found');
	}

	// manually set the content length if you'd like
	header('Content-Length: '.filesize($filePath));
	// or
	$response->setRealHeader('Content-Length: '.filesize($filePath));

	// Stream the file to the client as it's read
	readfile($filePath);

// This is the magic line here
})->stream();
```

#### Stream with Headers

You can also use the `streamWithHeaders()` method to set the headers before you start streaming.

```php
Flight::route('/stream-users', function() {

	// you can add any additional headers you want here
	// you just must use header() or Flight::response()->setRealHeader()

	// however you pull your data, just as an example...
	$users_stmt = Flight::db()->query("SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM users");

	echo '{';
	$user_count = count($users);
	while($user = $users_stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
		echo json_encode($user);
		if(--$user_count > 0) {
			echo ',';
		}

		// This is required to send the data to the client
		ob_flush();
	}
	echo '}';

// This is how you'll set the headers before you start streaming.
})->streamWithHeaders([
	'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
	'Content-Disposition' => 'attachment; filename="users.json"',
	// optional status code, defaults to 200
	'status' => 200
]);
```

## Troubleshooting
- Route parameters are matched by order, not by name. Ensure callback parameter order matches route definition.
- Using `Flight::get()` does not define a route; use `Flight::route('GET /...')` for routing or the Router object context in groups (e.g. `$router->get(...)`).
- The executedRoute property is only set after a route executes; it is NULL before execution.
- Streaming requires legacy Flight output buffering functionality to be disabled (`flight.v2.output_buffering = false`).
- For dependency injection, only certain route definitions support container-based instantiation.
