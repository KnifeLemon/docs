2. Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin (Plugins menu).
3. Go to **Settings > Flight Framework** to configure the plugin.
4. Set the vendor path to your Flight installation (or use Composer to install Flight).
5. Configure your app folder path and create the folder structure (the plugin can help with this!).

## Usage Examples

### Basic Route Example
In your `app/config/routes.php` file:

```php
Flight::route('GET /api/hello', function() {
    Flight::json(['message' => 'Hello World!']);
});
```

### Controller Example

Create a controller in `app/controllers/ApiController.php`:

```php
namespace app\controllers;

use Flight;

class ApiController {
    public function getUsers() {
        // You can use WordPress functions inside Flight!
        $users = get_users();
        $result = [];
        foreach($users as $user) {
            $result[] = [
                'id' => $user->ID,
                'name' => $user->display_name,
                'email' => $user->user_email
            ];
        }
        Flight::json($result);
    }
}
```

Then, in your `routes.php`:

```php
Flight::route('GET /api/users', [app\controllers\ApiController::class, 'getUsers']);
```

## FAQ

A: Yes, this is for developers who want to use Flight within WordPress. Basic knowledge of Flight's routing and request handling is recommended.

**Q: Can I use WordPress functions in my Flight app?**  
A: Absolutely! You have full access to all WordPress functions, hooks, and globals from within your Flight routes and controllers.

**Q: How do I create custom routes?**
