# Learn About Flight

Flight is a fast, simple, extensible framework for PHP. It is quite versatile and can be used for building any kind of web application. 
It is built with simplicity in mind and is written in a way that is easy to understand and use.

> **Note:** You will see examples that use `Flight::` as a static variable and some that use the `$app->` Engine object. Both work interchangeably with the other. `$app` and `$this->app` in a controller/middleware is the recommended approach from the Flight team.
