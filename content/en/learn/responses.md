# Responses

Flight helps generate part of the response headers for you, but you hold most of the control over what you send back to the user. Sometimes you can access the `Response` object directly, but most of the time you'll use the `Flight` instance to send a response.

## Sending a Basic Response

Flight uses ob_start() to buffer the output. This means you can use `echo` or `print` to send a response to the user and Flight will capture it and send it back to the user with the appropriate headers.

```php

// This will send "Hello, World!" to the user's browser
Flight::route('/', function() {
	echo "Hello, World!";
});

// HTTP/1.1 200 OK
// Content-Type: text/html
//
// Hello, World!
```

As an alternative, you can call the `write()` method to add to the body as well.

```php

// This will send "Hello, World!" to the user's browser
Flight::route('/', function() {
	// verbose, but gets the job sometimes when you need it
	Flight::response()->write("Hello, World!");

	// if you want to retrieve the body that you've set at this point
	// you can do so like this
	$body = Flight::response()->getBody();
});
```

## Status Codes

You can set the status code of the response by using the `status` method:

```php
Flight::route('/@id', function($id) {
	if($id == 123) {
		Flight::response()->status(200);
		echo "Hello, World!";
	} else {
		Flight::response()->status(403);
		echo "Forbidden";
	}
});
```

If you want to get the current status code, you can use the `status` method without any arguments:

```php
Flight::response()->status(); // 200
```

## Running a Callback on the Response Body

You can run a callback on the response body by using the `addResponseBodyCallback` method:

```php
Flight::route('/users', function() {
	$db = Flight::db();
	$users = $db->fetchAll("SELECT * FROM users");
	Flight::render('users_table', ['users' => $users]);
});

// This will gzip all the responses for any route
Flight::response()->addResponseBodyCallback(function($body) {
	return gzencode($body, 9);
});
```

You can add multiple callbacks and they will be run in the order they were added. Because this can accept any callback, it can accept a class array `[ $class, 'method' ]`, a closure `$strReplace = function($body) { str_replace('hi', 'there', $body); };`, or a function name `'minify'` if you had a function to minify your html code for example.

```php

**Note:** This will not work if you are using the `flight.v2.output_buffering` configuration option.

## Setting a Response Header

You can set a header such as content type of the response by using the `header` method:

```php

// This will send "Hello, World!" to the user's browser in plain text
Flight::route('/', function() {
	Flight::response()->header('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
	echo "Hello, World!";
});
```

## JSON

Flight provides support for sending JSON and JSONP responses. To send a JSON response you
pass some data to be JSON encoded:

```php
Flight::json(['id' => 123]);
```

### JSONP

For JSONP requests you, can optionally pass in the query parameter name you are
using to define your callback function:

```php
Flight::jsonp(['id' => 123], 'q');
```

So, when making a GET request using `?q=my_func`, you should receive the output:

```javascript
my_func({"id":123});
```

If you don't pass in a query parameter name it will default to `jsonp`.

## Redirect to another URL

You can redirect the current request by using the `redirect()` method and passing
in a new URL:

```php
Flight::redirect('/new/location');
```

By default Flight sends a HTTP 303 ("See Other") status code. You can optionally set a
custom code:

```php
Flight::redirect('/new/location', 401);
```

## Stopping

You can stop the framework at any point by calling the `halt` method:

```php
Flight::halt();
```

You can also specify an optional `HTTP` status code and message:

```php
Flight::halt(200, 'Be right back...');
```

Calling `halt` will discard any response content up to that point. If you want to stop
the framework and output the current response, use the `stop` method:

```php
Flight::stop();
```

## HTTP Caching

Flight provides built-in support for HTTP level caching. If the caching condition
is met, Flight will return an HTTP `304 Not Modified` response. The next time the
client requests the same resource, they will be prompted to use their locally
cached version.

### Route Level Caching

If you want to cache your whole response, you can use the `cache()` method and pass in time to cache.

```php

// This will cache the response for 5 minutes
Flight::route('/news', function () {
  Flight::response()->cache(time() + 300);
  echo 'This content will be cached.';
});

// Alternatively, you can use a string that you would pass
// to the strtotime() method
Flight::route('/news', function () {
  Flight::response()->cache('+5 minutes');
  echo 'This content will be cached.';
});
```

### Last-Modified

You can use the `lastModified` method and pass in a UNIX timestamp to set the date
and time a page was last modified. The client will continue to use their cache until
the last modified value is changed.

```php
Flight::route('/news', function () {
  Flight::lastModified(1234567890);
  echo 'This content will be cached.';
});
```

### ETag

`ETag` caching is similar to `Last-Modified`, except you can specify any id you
want for the resource:

```php
Flight::route('/news', function () {
  Flight::etag('my-unique-id');
  echo 'This content will be cached.';
});
```

Keep in mind that calling either `lastModified` or `etag` will both set and check the
cache value. If the cache value is the same between requests, Flight will immediately
send an `HTTP 304` response and stop processing.
