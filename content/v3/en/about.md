## Quick Start

To do a fast bare bones install, install it with Composer:

```bash
composer require flightphp/core
```

Or you can download a zip of the repo [here](https://github.com/flightphp/core). Then you'd have a basic `index.php` file like the following:

```php
<?php

// if installed with composer
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
// or if installed manually by zip file
// require 'flight/Flight.php';

Flight::route('/', function() {
  echo 'hello world!';
});

Flight::route('/json', function() {
  Flight::json([
	'hello' => 'world'
  ]);
});

Flight::start();
```

That's it! You have a basic Flight application. You can now run this file with `php -S localhost:8000` and visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the output.

## Skeleton/Boilerplate App

There's an example app to help you start your project with Flight. It has a structured layout, basic configs all set and handle composer scripts right out of the gate! Check out [flightphp/skeleton](https://github.com/flightphp/skeleton) for a ready-to-go project, or visit the [examples](examples) page for inspiration. Want to see how AI fits in?

## Installing the Skeleton App

Easy enough!

```bash
# Create the new project
composer create-project flightphp/skeleton my-project/
# Enter your new project directory
cd my-project/
# Bring up the local dev-server to get started right away!
composer start
```

It will create the project structure, setup the files you need, and you're ready to go!

## High Performance

Flight is one of the fastest PHP frameworks out there. Its lightweight core means less overhead and more speed—perfect for both traditional apps and modern AI-powered projects.

1. Contribute to the core framework by visiting the [core repository](https://github.com/flightphp/core).
2. Help make the docs better! This documentation website is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/flightphp/docs). If you spot an error or want to improve something, feel free to submit a pull request. We love updates and new ideas—especially around AI and new tech!

# Requirements

Flight requires PHP 7.4 or greater.

**Note:** PHP 7.4 is supported because at the current time of writing (2024) PHP 7.4 is the default version for some LTS Linux distributions. Forcing a move to PHP >8 would cause a lot of heartburn for those users. The framework also supports PHP >8.
