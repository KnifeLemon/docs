# Migrating From Another Framework

If you are migrating from another framework such as Laravel, Slim, Fat-Free, or Symfony to Flight, this page will help you understand the differences between the two.

## Laravel

Laravel is a full-featured framework that has all the bells and whistles and an amazing developer focused ecosystem, but at a cost in performance and complexity. 

[See the comparison between Laravel and Flight](/learn/migrating-from-laravel).

## Slim

Slim is a micro-framework that is similar to Flight. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, but can be a bit more complex than Flight.

[See the comparison between Slim and Flight](/learn/migrating-from-slim).

## Fat-Free

Fat-Free is a full-stack framework in a much smaller package. While it has all the tools in the toolbox, it does have a data architecture that can make some projects more complex than they need to be.

[See the comparison between Fat-Free and Flight](/learn/migrating-from-fat-free).

## Symfony

Symfony is a modular, enterprise level framework that is designed to be flexible and scalable. For smaller projects or newer developers, Symfony can be a bit overwhelming.
